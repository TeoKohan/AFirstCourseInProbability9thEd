\item Let $E$, $F$, and $G$ be three events. Find expressions so that, of E, F, and G,
\begin{enumerate}
     \item only E occurs
     \[ E \]
     \item both E and G, but not F, occur
     \[ EF^\complement G \]
     \item at least one of the events occurs
     \[ E\cup F\cup G \]
     \item at least two of the events occur
     \[ EF\cup EG\cup FG \]
     \item all three events occur
     \[ EFG \]
     \item none of the events occurs
     \[ E^\complement F^\complement G^\complement  \]
     \item at most one of the events occurs
     \[ E^\complement F^\complement G^\complement \cup EF^\complement G^\complement \cup E^\complement FG^\complement \cup E^\complement F^\complement G \]
     \item at most two of the events occur
     \[ (EFG)^\complement  \]
     \item exactly two of the events occur
     \[ EFG^\complement \cup EF^\complement G\cup E^\complement FG \]
     \item at most three of the events occur
     \[ S \]
\end{enumerate}
