\item Ten cards are randomly chosen from a deck of 52 cards that consists of 13 cards of each of 4 different suits. Each of the selected cards is put in one of 4 piles, depending onthe suit of the card.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the probability that the largest pile has 4 cards, the next largest has 3, the next largest has 2, and the smallest has 1 card?
    \[ \frac{4! * \binom{13}{4}\binom{13}{3}\binom{13}{2}\binom{13}{1}}{\binom{52}{10}} \]
    \item What is the probability that two of the piles have 3 cards, one has 4 cards, and one has no cards?
    \[ \frac{\binom{4}{3} \binom{3}{2} \binom{13}{4}\binom{13}{3}\binom{13}{3}}{\binom{52}{10}} \]
\end{enumerate}
