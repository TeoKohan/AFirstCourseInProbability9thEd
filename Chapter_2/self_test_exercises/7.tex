\item In a state lottery, a player must choose 8 of the numbers from 1 to 40. The lottery commission then performs an experiment that selects 8 of these 40 numbers. Assuming that the choice of the lottery commission is equally likely to be any of the $\binom{40}{8}$ combinations, what is the probability that a player has
\begin{enumerate}
    \item all 8 of the numbers selected by the lottery commission?
    \[ \frac{\binom{8}{8}}{\binom{40}{8}} \]
    \item 7 of the numbers selected by the lottery commission?
    \[ \frac{\binom{8}{7}\binom{32}{1}}{\binom{40}{8}} \]
    \item at least 6 of the numbers selected by the lottery commission?
    \[ \frac{\binom{8}{6}\binom{32}{2}}{\binom{40}{8}} + \frac{\binom{8}{7}\binom{32}{1}}{\binom{40}{8}} + \frac{\binom{8}{8}}{\binom{40}{8}} \]
\end{enumerate}
