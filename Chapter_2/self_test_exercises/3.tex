\item A deck of cards is dealt out. What is the probability that the 14th card dealt is an ace? What is the probability that the first ace occurs on the 14th card?

\[ \frac{4 * \binom{51}{13}}{14 * \binom{52}{14}} \]
la probabilidad de que el primer as ocurra en la carta catorceava
\[ \frac{4 * \binom{48}{13}}{14 * \binom{52}{14}} \]
