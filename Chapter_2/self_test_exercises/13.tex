\item Suppose that a person chooses a letter at random from R\,E\,S\,E\,R\,V\,E and then chooses one at random from \,V\,E\,R\,T\,I\,C\,A\,L. What is the probability that the same letter is chosen?
\[ 
\tfrac{2}{7} * \tfrac{1}{8} + \tfrac{3}{7} * \tfrac{1}{8} +
\tfrac{1}{7} * \tfrac{0}{8} + \tfrac{1}{7} * \tfrac{1}{8} = \tfrac{3}{28}  \]
