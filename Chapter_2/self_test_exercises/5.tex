\item An ordinary deck of 52 cards is shuffled. What is the probability that the top four cards have
\begin{enumerate}
    \item different denominations?
    \[ \frac{\binom{13}{4}\binom{4}{1}^4}{\binom{52}{4}} \]
    \item different suits?
    \[ \frac{\binom{13}{1}^4}{\binom{52}{4}} \]
\end{enumerate}
