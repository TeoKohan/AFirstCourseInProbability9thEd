\item Consider an experiment that consists of 6 horses, numbered 1 through 6, running a race, and suppose that the sample space consists of the 6! possible orders in which the horses finish. Let $A$ be the event that the number-1 horse is among the top three finishers, and let $B$ be the event thatthe number-2 horse comes in second. How many outcomes are in the event $A \cup B$?

tenemos $N(A \cup B) = N(A) + N(B) - N(AB)$, $N(A) = 3 * 5!$, $N(B) = 5!$, $N(AB) = 2 * 4!$ por lo tanto
\[ N(A\cup B) = 4 * 5! - 2 * 4! \]
