\item A basketball team consists of 6 frontcourt and 4 backcourt players. If players are divided into roommates at random, what is the probability that there will be exactly two roommate pairs made up of a backcourt and a frontcourt player?
\[ \frac{\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} * 2 * 3}{\frac{\binom{10}{2,2,2,2,2}}{5!}} \]
