\item Four red, 8 blue, and 5 green balls are randomly arranged in a line.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the probability that the first 5 balls are blue?
    \[ \frac{\binom{8}{5} * 5! * 12!}{17!} \]
    \item What is the probability that none of the first 5 balls is blue?
    \[ \frac{9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 12!}{17!} \]
    \item What is the probability that the final 3 balls are of different colors?
    \[ \frac{4 * 8 * 5 * 3! * 14!}{17!} \]
    \item What is the probability that all the red balls are together?
    \[ \frac{4! * 14!}{17!} \]
\end{enumerate}
