\item A hospital administrator codes incoming patients suffering gunshot wounds according to whether they have insurance (coding 1 if they do and 0 if they do not) and according to their condition, which is rated as good (g), fair (f), or serious (s). Consider an experiment that consists of the coding of such a patient.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Give the sample space of this experiment.
    \[
        S = \set{(0,g),(0,f),(0,s),(1,g),(1,f),(1,s)}
    \]
    \item Let $A$ be the event that the patient is in serious condition. Specify the outcomes in $A$.
    \[ A = \set{(0,s),(1,s)} \]
    \item Let $B$ be the event that the patient is uninsured. Specify the outcomes in $B$.
    \[ B = \set{(0,g),(0,f),(0,s)} \]
    \item Give all the outcomes in the event $B^\complement  \cup A$.
    \[ B^\complement  \cup A = \set{(0,s),(1,g),(1,f),(1,s)} \]
\end{enumerate}
