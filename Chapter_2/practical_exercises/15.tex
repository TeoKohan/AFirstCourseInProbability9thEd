\item In a game of poker, what is the probability of being dealt
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a flush? (A hand is said to be a flush if all 5 cards are of the same suit.)
    \[ \frac{\binom{4}{1} * \binom{13}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}} \]
    \item one pair? (This occurs when the cards have denominations $a$, $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are all distinct.)
    \[ \frac{\binom{13}{1} * \binom{4}{2} * \binom{12}{3} * \binom{4}{1}^3}{\binom{52}{5}} \]
    \item two pairs? (This occurs when the cards have denominations $a$, $a$, $b$, $b$, $c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all distinct.)
    \[ \frac{\binom{13}{2} * \binom{4}{2}^2 * \binom{11}{1} * \binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}} \]
    \item three of a kind? (This occurs when the cards have denominations $a$, $a$, $a$, $b$, $c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all distinct.)
    \[ \frac{\binom{13}{1} * \binom{4}{3} * \binom{12}{2} * \binom{4}{2}^2}{\binom{52}{5}} \]
    \item four of a kind? (This occurs when the cards have denominations $a$, $a$, $a$, $a$, $b$.)
    \[ \frac{\binom{13}{1} * \binom{4}{4} * \binom{12}{1} * \binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}} \]
\end{enumerate}
