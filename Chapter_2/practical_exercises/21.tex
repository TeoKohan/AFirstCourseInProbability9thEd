\item A small community organization consists of 20 families, of which 4 have one child, 8 have two children, 5 have three children, 2 have four children, and 1 has five children.

%4+2*8+3*5+4*2+5*1=20+23+5=48

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If one of these families is chosen at random, what is the probability it has $i$ children, $i = 1,2,3,4,5$?
    \[ 1.\ \frac{4}{20} \quad 2.\ \frac{8}{20} \quad 3.\ \frac{5}{20} \quad 4.\ \frac{2}{20} \quad 5.\ \frac{1}{20} \quad \]
    \item If one of the children is randomly chosen, what is the probability that child comes from a family having $i$ children, $i = 1,2,3,4,5$?
    \[ 1.\ \frac{4}{48} \quad 2.\ \frac{16}{48} \quad 3.\ \frac{15}{48} \quad 4.\ \frac{8}{48} \quad 5.\ \frac{5}{48} \quad \]
