\item A forest contains 20 elk, of which 5 are captured, tagged, and then released. A certain time later, 4 of the 20 elk are captured. What is the probability that 2 of these 4 have been tagged? What assumptions are you making?

\[ \frac{\binom{5}{2} * \binom{15}{2}}{\binom{20}{4}} \]
Asumimos que los hechos son independientes.
