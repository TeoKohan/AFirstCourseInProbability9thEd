\item How many people have to be in a room in order that the probability that at least two of them celebrate their birthday in the same month is at least $\tfrac{1}{2}$? Assume that all possible monthly outcomes are equally likely.

Para $1 \le n \le 12$
\begin{align*}
    1 - \frac{\frac{12!}{(12-n)!}}{12^n}
\end{align*}
Que es mayor a $\tfrac{1}{2}$ cuando $n \ge 5$.
