\item A retail establishment accepts either the American Express or the VISA credit card. A total of 24 percent of its customers carry an American Express card, 61 percent carry a VISA card, and 11 percent carry both cards. What percentage of its customers carry a credit card that the establishment will accept?
\begin{align*}
    P(A\cup V) &= P(A) + P(V) - P(A \cap V)\\
    &= .24 + .61 - .11\\
    &= .74
\end{align*}
