\item A system is composed of 5 components, each of which is either working or failed. Consider an experiment that consists of observing the status of each component, and let the outcome of the experiment be given by the vector $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$, where $x_i$ is equal to 1 if component $i$ is working and is equal to 0 if component $i$ is failed.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many outcomes are in the sample space of this experiment?
    \[ S = \set{0,1}^5,\quad \#(S) = 2^5 \]
    \item Suppose that the system will work if components 1 and 2 are both working, or if components 3 and 4 are both working, or if components 1, 3, and 5 are all working. Let $W$ be the event that the system will work. Specify all the outcomes in $W$.
    \begin{align*}
        &11000,11001,11010,11011,11100,\\
        &11101,11110,11111,00110,00111,\\
        &01110,01111,10110,10111,10101
    \end{align*}
    \item Let $A$ be the event that components 4 and 5 are both failed. How many outcomes are contained in the event $A$?
    \[ 2^3 \]
    \item Write out all the outcomes in the event $AW$.
    \[
        11000,11100
    \]
