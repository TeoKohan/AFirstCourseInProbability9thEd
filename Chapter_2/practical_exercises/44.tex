\item Five people, designated as $A, B, C, D, E$, are arranged in linear order. Assuming that each possible order is equally likely, what is the probability that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item there is exactly one person between $A$ and $B$?
    \[ \frac{2 * \binom{3}{1} * 1! * 3!}{5!} \]
    \item there are exactly two people between $A$ and $B$?
    \[ \frac{2 * \binom{3}{2} * 2! * 2!}{5!} \]
    \item there are three people between $A$ and $B$?
    \[ \frac{2 * \binom{3}{3} * 3! * 1!}{5!} \]
\end{enumerate}
