\item Sixty percent of the students at a certain school wear neither a ring nor a necklace. Twenty percent wear a ring and 30 percent wear a necklace. If one of the students is chosen randomly, what is the probability that this student is wearing
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a ring or a necklace?
    \begin{align*}
        &\phantom{\;=\;} P(R\cup N)\\
        &= 1 - P(R^c\cap N^c)\\
        &= 1 - .6\\
        &= .4
    \end{align*}
    \item a ring and a necklace?
    \begin{align*}
        &\phantom{\;=\;} P(R\cap N)\\
        &= P(R) + P(N) - P(R \cup N)\\
        &= .2 + .3 - .4\\
        &= .1
    \end{align*}
