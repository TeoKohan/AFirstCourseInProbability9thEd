\item A woman has $n$ keys, of which one will open her door.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If she tries the keys at random, discarding those that do not work, what is the probability that she will open the door on her $k$th try?
    \[ \frac{1}{n} \]
    \item What if she does not discard previously tried keys?
    \[ \Big(\frac{n-1}{n}\Big)^{k-1} * \frac{1}{n} \]
\end{enumerate}
