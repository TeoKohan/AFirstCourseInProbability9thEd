\item There are $n$ socks, 3 of which are red, in a drawer. What is the value of $n$ if, when 2 of the socks are chosen randomly, the probability that they are both red is $\frac{1}{2}$.
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{2} &= P(\{2 \text{ red}\})\\
    &= \frac{\binom{3}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}}\\
    &= \frac{3 * 2}{(n-1) * n}
    \shortintertext{entonces}
    (n-1) * n &= 12\\
    n &= 4
\end{align*}
