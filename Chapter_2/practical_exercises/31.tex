\item A 3-person basketball team consists of a guard, a forward, and a center.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If a person is chosen at random from each of three different such teams, what is the probability of selecting a complete team?
    \[ \frac{3}{3} * \frac{2}{3} * \frac{1}{3} \]
    \item What is the probability that all 3 players selected play the same position?
    \[ \frac{3}{3} * \frac{1}{3} * \frac{1}{3} \]
