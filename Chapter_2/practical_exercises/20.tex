\item Suppose that you are playing blackjack against a dealer. In a freshly shuffled deck, what is the probability that neither you nor the dealer is dealt a blackjack?

\begin{align*}
    &\phantom{\;=\;} P(A^c\cap B^c)\\
    &= 1 - P(A\cup B)\\
    &= 1 - (P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B))\\
    &= 1 
    - \Bigg (\frac{4^3}{\binom{52}{2}} + \frac{4^3}{\binom{52}{2}} 
    - \frac{\binom{4}{2} * \binom{16}{2} * (4! - 8)}{\binom{52}{4} * 4!}\Bigg )\\
    &\approx .0983
\end{align*}
