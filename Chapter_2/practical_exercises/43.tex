\item 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $N$ people, including $A$ and $B$, are randomly arranged in a line, what is the probability that $A$ and $B$ are next to each other?
    \[ \frac{2 * \binom{N-1}{1} * (N-2)!}{N!} = \frac{2}{N} \]
    \item What would the probability be if the people were randomly arranged in a circle?
    \[ \frac{N}{\binom{N}{2}} = \frac{2}{N-1} \]
\end{enumerate}
