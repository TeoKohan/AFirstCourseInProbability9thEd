\item An instructor gives her class a set of 10 problems with the information that the final exam will consist of a random selection of 5 of them. If a student has figured out how to do 7 of the problems, what is the probability that he or she will answer correctly
\begin{enumerate}
    \item all 5 problems?
    \[ \frac{\binom{7}{5}}{\binom{10}{5}} \]
    \item at least 4 of the problems?
    \[ 
    \frac{\binom{7}{4}*\binom{3}{1}}{\binom{10}{5}} 
    + 
    \frac{\binom{7}{5}}{\binom{10}{5}} \]
\end{enumerate}
