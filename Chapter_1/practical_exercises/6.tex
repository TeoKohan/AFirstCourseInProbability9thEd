\item A well-known nursery rhyme starts as follows:
\begin{verse}
    \enquote{
    As I was going to St.\@ Ives\\
    I met a man with 7 wives.\\
    Each wife had 7 sacks.\\
    Each sack had 7 cats.\\
    Each cat had 7 kittens...}
\end{verse}
How many kittens did the traveler meet?
\[ 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 \]
