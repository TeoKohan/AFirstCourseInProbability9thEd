\item A person has 8 friends, of whom 5 will be invited to a party.

    \item How many choices are there if 2 of the friends are feuding and will not attend together?
    \[ \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{3} \]
    \item How many choices if 2 of the friends will only attend together?
    \[ \binom{6}{5} + \binom{6}{3} \]
\end{enumerate}
