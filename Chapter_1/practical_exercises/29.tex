\item Ten weight lifters are competing in a team weightlifting contest. Of the lifters, 3 are from the United States, 4 are from Russia, 2 are from China, and 1 is from Canada. If the scoring takes account of the countries that the lifters represent, but not their individual identities, how many different outcomes are possible from the point of view of scores? How many different outcomes correspond to results in which the United States has 1 competitor in top three and 2 in the bottom three?

\[ \binom{10}{3,4,2,1} \]
Si requerimos que estados unidos tenga un competidor entre los tres primeros y 2 entre los tres Ãºltimos
\[ \binom{3}{1} * \binom{3}{2} * \binom{7}{4,2,1} \]
