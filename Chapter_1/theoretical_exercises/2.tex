\item Two experiments are to be performed. The first can result in any one of $m$ possible outcomes. If the first experiment results in outcome $i$, then the second experiment can result in any of $n_i$ possible outcomes, $i = 1,2,\dots,m$. What is the number of possible outcomes of the two experiments?
\[ \sum_{i=1}^m n_i \]
