\item A total of $n$ students are enrolled in a review course for the actuarial examination in probability. The posted results of the examination will list the names of those who passed, in decreasing order of their scores. For instance, the posted result will be \enquote{Brown, Cho} if Brown and Cho are the only ones to pass, with Brown receiving the higher score. Assuming that all scores are distinct (no ties), how many posted results are possible?
\[
\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} * i!
\]
