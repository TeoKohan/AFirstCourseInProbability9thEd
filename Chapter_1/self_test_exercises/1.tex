\item  How many different linear arrangements are there of the letters A, B, C, D, E, F for which
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A and B are next to each other?
    \[ 2 * 5! \]
    \item A is before B
    \[ \frac{6!}{2!} \]
    \item A is before B and B is before C?
    \[ \frac{6!}{3!} \]
    \item A is before B and C is before D?
    \[ \frac{6!}{2! * 2!} \]
    \item A and B are next to each other and C and D are also next to each other?
