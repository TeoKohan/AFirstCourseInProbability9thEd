\item Consider $n$-digit numbers where each digit is one of the 10 integers $0,1,\dots,9$. How many such numbers are there for which
\begin{enumerate}
    \item no two consecutive digits are equal?
    \[ 10 * 9^{n-1} \]
    \item 0 appears as a digit a total of $i$ times, $i = 0,\dots,n$?
    \[ \binom{n-1}{i} * 9^{n-i} \]
\end{enumerate}
