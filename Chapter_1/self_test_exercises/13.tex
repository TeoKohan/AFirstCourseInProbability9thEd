\item An art collection on auction consisted of 4 Dalis, 5 van Goghs, and 6 Picassos. At the auction were 5 art collectors. If a reporter noted only the number of Dalis, van Goghs, and Picassos acquired by each collector, how many different results could have been recorded if all of the works were sold?
\[ \binom{4+5-1}{5-1} * \binom{5+5-1}{5-1} * \binom{6+5-1}{5-1} \]
