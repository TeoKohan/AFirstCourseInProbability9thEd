    \item there are no restrictions?
    \[ \binom{10}{3} * 3! \]

    \[ \binom{10}{3} * 3! - 3 * 2 * 8 \]
    \item C and D will serve together or not at all?
    \[ 3 * 2 * 8 + \binom{8}{3} * 3! \]
    \item E must be an officer?
    \[ \binom{9}{2} * 3! \]
    \item F will serve only if he is president?
    \[ \binom{9}{2} * 2! + \binom{9}{3} * 3! \]
\end{enumerate}
