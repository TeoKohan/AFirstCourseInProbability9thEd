\item From 10 married couples, we want to select a group of 6 people that is not allowed to contain a married couple.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many choices are there?
    \[ \binom{10}{6} * 2^6 \]
    
    \item How many choices are there if the group must also consist of 3 men and 3 women?
    \[ \binom{10}{3} * \binom{7}{3} \]
\end{enumerate}
